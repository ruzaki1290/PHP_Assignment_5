# PHP_Assignment_5

## Updates to the project Assignment 4

New directory and files had been added to the project. The new directory is called `customer_manager` and it contains the following files: `index.php` and `view_update_customer.php`.

## Overview

This project involves creating a customer management system that allows users to view, search, and update customer data. The system is built using PHP and MySQL and consists of two main pages: `index.php` and `view_update_customer.php`.

## Direcotry Structure

``` php
- customer_manager/
  - index.php
  - view_update_customer.php
```

## Functionality

### `index.php`

* **Customer Data Display**: Fetches customer data from a MySQL database and displays it in a table format.
* **Search Bar**: Includes a search bar that allows users to look up customers by their last name.
* **Select Button**: Each customer row has a "Select" button that redirects the user to the `view_update_customer.php` page for the selected customer.

### `view_update_customer.php`

* **Detailed Customer Form**: Displays a detailed form with the selected customer's data.
* **Update Functionality**: Allows users to add and modify customer data.

## How It Works

1. **Customer Data Fetching**: The `index.php` page fetches customer data from the MySQL database and displays it in a table.
2. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for customers by their last name using the search bar.
3. **Select Customer**: Users can select a customer by clicking the "Select" button, which redirects them to the `view_update_customer.php` page.
4. **View and Update Customer Data**: The `view_update_customer.php` page displays a detailed form with the selected customer's data, allowing users to update the information.
